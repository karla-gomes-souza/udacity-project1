### Installation
It is necessary to install the researchpy library to run the code. The python version must be >= 3.9.

### Project Motivation

This project is dedicated to the course of the Data Scientist nanodegree program from Udacity. 
It corresponds to the Project: Writing a Data Science Blog Post. To come up with the analysis, the dataset chosen was
"Students performance in exams" from Kaggle.

The three main questions to be answered are:
- Does the parental level of education has any impact to the overall average score?
- The students who completed the test preparation were able to get a higher average score than those who didnâ€™t?
- Is there any difference between performance/score in disciplines by gender?


### File Descriptions
There are 2 notebooks. The data_analysis.ipynb file corresponds to an exploratory and statistical analysis in the data,
where the main goal is to use those tools to answer the three questions mentioned above. The other file, predict_score.ipynb,
corresponds to the linear regression model used to predict the average score of all subjects.

### Results
The main findings can be found [here](https://medium.com/@sgomes.karla/this-is-why-some-students-perform-better-than-others-3d726c50e26d).

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
The license of the data is unknown. More information about the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
